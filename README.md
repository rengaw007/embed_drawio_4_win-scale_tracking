Let’s install these app scripts using our own accounts by following these instructions:

# Step 1: 
Open Slides and select “Apps Script” from the “Extensions” menu.
# Step 2: 
In the open editor, copy the code from Code.gs and paste it into the editor. Then, create a new HTML file named “Picker.html” and copy the code from Picker.html and paste it into the editor.
# Step 3: 
Save the project and give it a name (e.g., My draw.io).
# Step 4: 
Click the Deploy button and select “Test deployments.” From the deployment type gear icon, select “Editor Add-on.”
# Step 5: 
Click “Add test” and select a document to test on. Then, click the “Save Test” button.
# Step 6: 
Finally, select the newly created test and click the “Execute” button. The document will open, and you can access the add-on from the “Extensions” menu -> “You project name (e.g., My draw.io).”
